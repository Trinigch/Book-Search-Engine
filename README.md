# Book-Search-Engine
This repository contains a refactor of an existing Google Books API search engine, transitioning it from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The application is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and is designed to search for books via the Google Books API.
